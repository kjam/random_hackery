    "Detecting so-called \"fake news\" is no easy task. First, there is defining what fake news is -- given it has now become a political statement. If you can find or agree upon a definition, then you must collect and properly label real and fake news (hopefully on similar topics to best show clear distinctions). Once collected, you must then find useful features to determine fake from real news. \n",

    "For a more in-depth look at this problem space, I recommend taking a look at Miguel Martinez-Alvarez's post [\"How can Machine Learning and AI Help Solve the Fake News Problem\"](https://miguelmalvarez.com/2017/03/23/how-can-machine-learning-and-ai-help-solving-the-fake-news-problem/).\n",

The author even created a [repository with the dataset of tagged fake and real news examples](https://github.com/GeorgeMcIntire/fake_real_news_dataset). I was curious if I could easily reproduce the results, and if I could then determine what the model had learned. \n",

Depending on your problem, one of these might be more significant. For example, for the fake news problem, is it more important that we don't label real news articles as fake news? If so, we might want to eventually weight our accuracy score to better reflect this concern.\n",

    "Another vectorizer used sometimes for text classification is a `HashingVectorizer`. `HashingVectorizer`s require less memory and are faster (because they are sparse and use hashes rather than tokens) but are more difficult to introspect. You can read a bit more about the pros and cons of using [`HashingVectorizer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.HashingVectorizer.html) in the scikit-learn documentation if you are interested.\n",

It performs fairly well, with better results than the TF-IDF vectorizer using `MultinomialNB` (this is somewhat expected due to the same reasons `CountVectorizer`s perform better), but not as well as the TF-IDF vectorizer with Passive Aggressive linear algorithm."

    "So was your fake news classifier experiment a success? Definitely not. \n",

    "\n",
    "As expected from the outset, defining fake news with simple bag-of-words or TF-IDF vectors is an oversimplified approach. Especially with a multilingual dataset full of noisy tokens. If you hadn't taken a look at what your model had actually learned, you might have thought the model learned something meaningful. So, remember: always introspect your models (as best you can!).\n",
    "\n",
    "I would be curious if you find other trends in the data I might have missed. I will be following up with a post on how different classifiers compare in terms of important features [on my blog](https://blog.kjamistan.com). If you spend some time researching and find anything interesting, feel free to share your findings and notes in the comments or you can always reach out on Twitter (I'm [@kjam](https://twitter.com/kjam)).\n",
